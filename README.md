# blackjack
Simple blackjack game.

Wanted to build something that makes use of classes to better understand it, the logic is actually the hard part. There are so many ways to do it that I had the paradox of choice ;p

Again, this is all my own code. Also tried to do this myself, this was not written using stack overflow ;p
